    "### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating and Distributing a Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Create Directory Structure**\n",
    "   First, create a directory for your package. The directory structure should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   my_package/\n",
    "   ├── my_package/\n",
    "   │   ├── __init__.py\n",
    "   │   └── simple_math.py\n",
    "   ├── LICENSE\n",
    "   ├── README.md\n",
    "   └── setup.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Write the Code**\n",
    "   In this example, we'll create a simple math package that provides basic addition and subtraction functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **my_package/simple_math.py**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add(a, b):\n",
    "       \"\"\"Returns the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n",
    "       return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "   def subtract(a, b):\n",
    "       \"\"\"Returns the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n",
    "       return a - b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `__init__.py` file inside the `my_package/` folder will make the folder a Python package. It can be empty or include some initialization code, such as importing functions from `simple_math.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **my_package/__init__.py**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from .simple_math import add, subtract\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Create a `setup.py` File**\n",
    "   The `setup.py` file tells Python how to build and distribute your package. Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **setup.py**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n",
    "\n",
    "   setup(\n",
    "       name='my_package',  # Package name\n",
    "       version='0.1',  # Version number\n",
    "       description='A simple math package',  # Brief description\n",
    "       long_description=open('README.md').read(),  # README as long description\n",
    "       long_description_content_type='text/markdown',  # Markdown format for README\n",
    "       author='Your Name',\n",
    "       author_email='your.email@example.com',\n",
    "       url='https://github.com/yourusername/my_package',  # GitHub or other URL\n",
    "       packages=find_packages(),  # Automatically find and include all packages\n",
    "       classifiers=[  # Metadata to categorize the package\n",
    "           'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',\n",
    "           'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',\n",
    "           'Operating System :: OS Independent',\n",
    "       ],\n",
    "       python_requires='>=3.6',  # Minimum Python version\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Add a License**\n",
    "   Choose an appropriate license for your package, such as the MIT License, and include it in the `LICENSE` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **LICENSE** (Example: MIT License)\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   MIT License\n",
    "   Copyright (c) 2024 Your Name\n",
    "   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Create a `README.md`**\n",
    "   The `README.md` file provides documentation and instructions for your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **README.md**\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   # My Package\n",
    "\n",
    "   A simple math package that provides basic addition and subtraction functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "   To install the package, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install my_package\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from my_package import add, subtract\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "   print(subtract(5, 2))  # Output: 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Build Your Package**\n",
    "   Before uploading the package, you need to build it. Use the following command to create a source distribution and a wheel distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will create a `dist/` directory with the distribution files (e.g., `my_package-0.1.tar.gz` and `my_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Install Twine**\n",
    "   You'll use **Twine** to upload your package to the Test PyPI repository (a testing environment for PyPI). First, install Twine if you haven't already:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install twine\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Upload to Test PyPI**\n",
    "   To test the upload process without affecting the main PyPI repository, you can upload your package to **Test PyPI**. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Register an account on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).\n",
    "   2. Use Twine to upload the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will be prompted to enter your Test PyPI username and password. After a successful upload, your package will be available for testing on Test PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Test Installing from Test PyPI**\n",
    "   To install the package from Test PyPI and test it locally, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ my_package\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command installs your package from the Test PyPI repository, allowing you to verify that everything works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- If everything works well on **Test PyPI**, you can repeat the process using the real **PyPI** repository:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  twine upload dist/*\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, your package will be available on PyPI for everyone to install using `pip`."
